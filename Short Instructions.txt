Here are short instructions on how to reproduce the work done:

1) Go the official website of the Life in Kyrgyzstan survey at https://lifeinkyrgyzstan.org/ to get familiar with the survey and the type of data collected.

2) Open the section on data access. To get access to the data you will need to register, sign the user contract and send it the IDSC. 

3) After the application is approved for, downloaded the necessary datasets (it is a longitudinal survey covering several years).

4) Perform the coding work as illustrated in the accompanying do-files.

5) The correct order of running do-files:
	a) tot_assets.do, sch_enrollment.do, remit_all_hhs.do, region.do, labor.do, ind_educ.do, exped_ed.do, BMI.do 
	b) then: hhold_comp.do, hhold_income
	c) then: tot_assets2011.do, sch_enrollment2011.do, remit_all_hhs2011.do, labor2011.do, ind_educ2011.do, exped_ed2011.do, BMI2011.do, hhold_comp2011.do
	d) then: hhold_income2011
	e) merged2010_sch_enrollment.do, merged2010_health.do, merged2010_labor.do, merged2010_exped_ed.do
	f) merged2011_sch_enrollment.do, merged2011_health.do, merged2011_labor.do, merged2011_exped_ed.do
	g) merged_sch_enr2010_2011.do, merged_health2010_2011.do, merged_labor2010_2011.do, merged_exp_ed2010_2011.do

6) There is a master do-file where you can run all the do-files.

7) Please note that due to the substantial coding work that had to be done to process and transform the data, I have not performed regression analysis in this project.
   However, simple OLS regression with output (regression tables and graphs) has been performed in a smaller project that you also have access to on Github ("Project").
